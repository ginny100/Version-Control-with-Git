# 4. Resetting Commits
## Reset vs Revert
- At first glance, `reset`ting might seem coincidentally close to `revert`ing, but they are actually quite different. 
  - `Reverting` _creates_ a `new commit` that reverts or undos a previous commit. 
  - `Resetting`, on the other hand, _erases_ `commits`!
- ⚠️ Resetting Is Dangerous ⚠️
  - You've got to be careful with `Git`'s resetting capabilities. This is one of the few commands that lets you _erase_ `commits` from the repository. If a `commit` is no longer in the repository, then its content is gone.
  - To alleviate the stress a bit, `Git` does keep track of everything for about 30 days before it completely erases anything. To access this content, you'll need to use the `git reflog` command. Check out these links for more info:

## Relative Commit References
- You can reference commits by their `SHA`, by `tags`, `branches`, and the special `HEAD pointer`. But, there will be times when you'll want to `reference a commit relative to another commit`. 
  - For example, there will be times where you'll want to tell `Git` about the `commit` that's one before the `current commit`...or two before the `current commit`.
  - There are special characters called `Ancestry References` that we can use to tell `Git` about these `relative references`. Those characters are:
    - `^` – indicates the parent commit
    - `~` – indicates the _first_ parent commit

- Here's how we can refer to previous commits:
  - The `parent commit` of the `current commit`
    - `HEAD^`
    - `HEAD~`
    - `HEAD~1`
  - The `grandparent commit` of the `current commit`
    - `HEAD^^`
    - `HEAD~2`
  - The `great-grandparent commit` of the `current commit`
    - `HEAD^^^`
    - `HEAD~3`

- The main difference between the `^` and the `~` is when a `commit` is created from a merge. A `merge commit` has two `parents`. With a `merge commit`, the `^` reference is used to indicate the `first parent` of the commit while `^2` indicates the `second parent`. The `first parent` is the branch you were on when you ran `git merge` while the `second parent` is the branch that was merged in.

### Which Commit?
- Use this repository to answer the following quiz questions:
```
* 9ec05ca (HEAD -> master) Revert "Set page heading to "Quests & Crusades""
* db7e87a Set page heading to "Quests & Crusades"
*   796ddb0 Merge branch 'heading-update'
|\  
| * 4c9749e (heading-update) Set page heading to "Crusade"
* | 0c5975a Set page heading to "Quest"
|/  
*   1a56a81 Merge branch 'sidebar'
|\  
| * f69811c (sidebar) Update sidebar with favorite movie
| * e6c65a6 Add new sidebar content
* | e014d91 (footer) Add links to social media
* | 209752a Improve site heading for SEO
* | 3772ab1 Set background color for page
|/  
* 5bfe5e7 Add starting HTML structure
* 6fa5f34 Add .gitignore file
* a879849 Add header to blog
* 94de470 Initial commit
```
- QUIZ QUESTION: Which commit is referenced by `HEAD~6`?
  1. 4c9749e
  2. 0c5975a
  3. 1a56a81
  4. f69811c
  5. e014d91
  6. 209752a
  ```
  Correct Answer: Option 6
  Hint: You just start at the current commit and work back 6 commits.
  ```
- Using the same repository, which commit is referenced by `HEAD~4^2`?
  ```
  Correct Answer: f69811c
  Hint: HEAD~4 references the fourth parent commit of the current one and then the ^2 tells us that it's the second parent of the merge commit (the one that got merged in!)
  ```

## The git reset Command
- The `git reset` command is used to reset (erase) commits:
```
git reset <reference-to-commit>
```
- It can be used to:
  - Move the `HEAD` and `current branch pointer` to the `referenced commit`
  - Erase `commits`
  - Move committed changes to the `staging index`
  - Unstage committed changes

### Git Reset's Flags
- The way `Git` determines if it erases, stages previously committed changes, or unstages previously committed changes is by the flag that's used. The flags are:
  - `--mixed`
  - `--soft`
  - `--hard`
- 💡 Backup Branch 💡
  - To create a `backup branch` on the `most-recent commit` use the command:
  ```
  git branch backup
  ```
  - If you created the `backup branch` prior to `reset`ting anything, then you can easily get back to having the `master branch` point to the `same commit` as the `backup branch`. You'll just need to:
    1. Remove the uncommitted changes from the working directory
    2. Merge `backup` into `master` (which will cause a `Fast-forward merge` and move `master` up to the same point as `backup`)

### Reset's --mixed Flag
```
* 9ec05ca (HEAD -> master) Revert "Set page heading to "Quests & Crusades""
* db7e87a Set page heading to "Quests & Crusades"
* 796ddb0 Merge branch 'heading-update'
```
- The sample repo above with `HEAD` pointing to `master` on commit `9ec05ca`, running `git reset --mixed HEAD^` will take the changes made in commit `9ec05ca` and `move` them to the `working directory`.

### Reset's --soft Flag
```
* 9ec05ca (HEAD -> master) Revert "Set page heading to "Quests & Crusades""
* db7e87a Set page heading to "Quests & Crusades"
* 796ddb0 Merge branch 'heading-update'
```
- Running `git reset --soft HEAD^` will take the changes made in commit `9ec05ca` and `move` them directly to the `Staging Index`.

### Reset's --hard Flag
```
* 9ec05ca (HEAD -> master) Revert "Set page heading to "Quests & Crusades""
* db7e87a Set page heading to "Quests & Crusades"
* 796ddb0 Merge branch 'heading-update'
```
- Running `git reset --hard HEAD^` will take the changes made in commit `9ec05ca` and `erases` them.

### Your try
- Refer to the following repository:
```
* e014d91 (HEAD -> master, footer) Add links to social media
* 209752a Improve site heading for SEO
* 3772ab1 Set background color for page
* 5bfe5e7 Add starting HTML structure
* 6fa5f34 Add .gitignore file
* a879849 Add header to blog
* 94de470 Initial commit
```

- QUIZ QUESTION: What will happen to the changes from the `3772ab1` commit if `git reset --hard HEAD~3` is run? Will the changes be in the `Staging Index`, in the `Working Directory`, or complete `erased`?
  1. Staging Index
  2. Working Directory
  3. erased
  ```
  Correct Answer: Option 3
  Hint: If the --hard flag is used, the changes are thrown out!
  ```
- QUIZ QUESTION: What will happen to the changes from the `209752a` commit if `git reset --soft HEAD^^` is run? Will the changes be in the `Staging Index`, in the `Working Directory`, or complete `erased`?
  1. Staging Index
  2. Working Directory
  3. erased
  ```
  Correct Answer: Option 1
  Hint: If the --soft flag is used, the changes are moved to the Staging Index!
  ```

## Recap
- The `git reset` command is used `erase` commits:
```
git reset <reference-to-commit>
```
- It can be used to:
  - Move the `HEAD` and `current branch pointer` to the `referenced commit`
  - `Erase commits` with the `--hard` flag
  - `Move` committed changes to the `staging index` with the `--soft` flag
  - `Unstage` committed changes `--mixed` flag
- Typically, `ancestry references` are used to indicate `previous commits`. The ancestry references are:
  - `^` – indicates the parent commit
  - `~` – indicates the first parent commit
