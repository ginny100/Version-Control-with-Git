# 3. Reverting A Commit
## What Is A Revert?
- When you tell `Git` to `revert` a specific `commit`, `Git` takes the changes that were made in `commit` and does the exact opposite of them. 
  - If a character is added in `commit A`, if `Git` reverts `commit A`, then `Git` will make a `new commit` where that character is deleted. It also works the other way where if a character/line is removed, then reverting that `commit` will add that content back!

## The git revert Command
- Now that we've made a commit with some changes, we can revert it with the git revert command
```
git revert <SHA-of-commit-to-revert>
```
- The output of the `git revert` command tells us what is reverted. `Git` uses the `commit message` of the `commit` that we told it to `revert`. Something that's also important is that it creates a `new commit`.

## Recap
- The `git revert` command is used to reverse a previously made commit:
```
git revert <SHA-of-commit-to-revert>
```
- Running the above command:
  - Will undo the changes that were made by the provided commit
  - Creates a new commit to record the change
