# 5. Git Diff
- `git status` tells us what files have been changed, but not what those changes actually were.
- The `git diff` command is used to find out this information!

## git diff
- The `git diff` command can be used to see changes that have been made but haven't been committed, yet.
- In `index.html`, let's reword the heading. Change the heading from `Expedition` to `Adventure`. Save the file and run `git diff` on the Terminal.
- The output of `git diff` is the same as `git log -p` since `git log -p` uses `git diff` under the hood.
  - These Changes Were Not Committed ðŸ’¡
    The changes in this section were used to demo the output of `git diff`. They were `not committed` to the repository. If you'd like, you can definitely commit the changes to the repository, just know that your `git log` will look slightly different from mine because it includes this extra commit.

## Recap
- The `git diff` command is used to see changes that have been made but haven't been committed, yet:
- The `git diff` command displays:
  - The files that have been modified
  - The location of the lines that have been added/removed
  - The actual changes that have been made
