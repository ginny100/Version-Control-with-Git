# 1. What is Version Control
- A `Version Control System` (VCS) is a software that helps you control (or manage) the different versions...of something (typically source code).
- Further Research: [Version Control on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)

## VCS Info
- There are [a number of Version Control Systems out there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software). Three of the most popular version control systems are:
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/)
  - [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)
- There are two main types of version control system models:
  - The `centralized model` - all users connect to a central, master repository
  - The `distributed model` - each user has the entire repository on their computer

## Recap
- The main point of a VCS is to help you maintain a detailed history of the project as well as the ability to work on different versions of it.
- Having a detailed history of a project is important because it lets you see the progress of the project over time. If needed, you can also jump back to any point in the project to recover data or files.
