# 3. Git and Version Control Terminology
## Terminology
### Version Control System / Source Code Manager
- A `version control system` (VCS) is a tool that manages different versions of source code. A `source code manager` (SCM) is another name for a `version control system`.

- `Git` is an `SCM` (and therefore a `VCS`!). The URL for the Git website is https://git-scm.com/ (see how it has "SCM" directly in its domain!).

### Commit
- `Git` thinks of its data like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem. Every time you `commit` (save the state of your project in Git), it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. You can think of it as a `save point` in a game - it saves your project's files and any information about them.

- Everything you do in `Git` is to help you make `commits`, so a `commit` is the fundamental unit in `Git`.

### Repository / repo
- A `repository` is a `directory` which contains your project work, as well as a few files (hidden by default on Mac OS X) which are used to communicate with `Git`. `Repositories` can exist either locally on your computer or as a remote copy on another computer. A `repository` is made up of `commits`.

### Working Directory
- The `Working Directory` is the files that you see in your computer's file system. When you open your project files up on a `code editor`, you're working with files in the `Working Directory`.

- This is in contrast to the files that have been saved (in `commits`!) in the `repository`.

- When working with `Git`, the `Working Directory` is also `different` from the command line's concept of the current working directory which is the directory that your `shell` is "looking at" right now.

### Checkout
- A `checkout` is when content in the repository has been copied to the `Working Directory`.

### Staging Area / Staging Index / Index
- A file in the `Git directory` that stores information about what will go into your `next commit`. You can think of the staging area as a prep table where `Git` will take the `next commit`. Files on the `Staging Index` are poised to be added to the `repository`.

### SHA
- A `SHA` is basically an `ID number` for each `commit`. Here's what a commit's SHA might look like: 
```
e2adf8ae3e2e4ed40add75cc44cf9d0a869afeb6.
```

- It is a 40-character string composed of characters (0–9 and a–f) and calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in `Git`. `SHA` is shorthand for `Secure Hash Algorithm`.

### Branch
- A `branch` is when a `new line` of development is created that diverges from the `main line` of development. This `alternative line` of development can continue without altering the `main line`.

- The key thing that makes `branches` incredibly powerful is that you can make `save points` on one `branch`, and then `switch` to a `different branch` and make `save points` there, too.

With this terminology in mind, let's take a high-level look at how we'll be using Git by looking at the typical workflow when working with version control.

## The typical workflow when working with version control
- In a `git repo`, there're three main areas: `Working Directory`, `Staging Index`, and `Repository`.
- Add a new file or modify one or more existing files in the `Working Directory` -> move the changes to the `Staging Index` -> commit those changes to the `Repository`.
- When a commit is made, only the changes that are on the `Staging Index` are moved into the `Repository`.
- Also when a commit is made, `Git` creates an `ID` for it, which is also known as a `SHA`.

- QUIZ QUESTION: The HTML file has HTML and CSS changes on the Staging Index and an additional HTML change in the Working Directory. From what you've learned so far with how committing works, what do you think will get committed if a commit were made right now?
  - Only the HTML file changes on the Staging Index
  - Only the CSS file changes on the Staging Index
  - The HTML and CSS file changes on the Staging Index
  - The HTML file changes in both the Working Directory and Staging Index
  ```
  Correct Answer: Option 3
  ```

## Recap
- At its core, `Git` records changes to files as `commits`. These `commits` are all saved in a `repository`. Everything else such as `working directory`, `branches`, and `SHAs` are there to help make and reference `commits`.
