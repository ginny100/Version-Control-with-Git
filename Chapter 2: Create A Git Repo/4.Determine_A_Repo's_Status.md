# 4. Determine A Repo's Status
- Working with `Git` on the `command line` can be a little bit challenging because it's a little bit like a black box. I mean, how do you know when you should or shouldn't run certain `Git commands`? Is `Git` ready for me to run a command yet? What if I run a command but I think it didn't work...how can I find that out? The answer to all of these questions is the `git status` command!
```
git status
```
- The `git status` is our key to the mind of `Git`. It will tell us what `Git` is thinking and the state of our repository as `Git` sees it. When you're first starting out, you should be using the `git status` command all of the time! Seriously. You should get into the habit of running it after any other command. This will help you learn how `Git` works and it'll help you from making (possibly) incorrect assumptions about the state of your files/repository.
- QUIZ QUESTION: To answer this quiz, make sure you've `cd`ed into the `course-git-blog-project` project. If you've been following along in this lesson and haven't added any files to this project, then what does running `git` status display?
  - ```
    Status: good
    ```
  - ```
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    Initial commit
    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
    ```
  - ```
    master branch
    Please commit some files
    ```
  - ```
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.nothing to commit, working directory clean
    ```
    ```
    Correct Answer: Option 4
    ```

## Git Status Output
- The `git status` command will display a lot of information depending on the state of your files, the working directory, and the repository. You don't need to worry too much about these, though...just run `git status` and it will display the information you need to know.

### Git Status Explanation
- Running `git status` in the `course-git-blog-project` project produces the following output:
```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```
- The output tells us three things:
  1. `On branch master` â€“ this tells us that `Git` is on the `master branch`. You've got a description of a branch on your terms sheet so this is the `master branch` (which is the `default branch`). We'll be looking more at branches in lesson 5
  2. `Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.` â€“ Because `git clone` was used to copy this repository from another computer, this is telling us if our project is in sync with the one we copied from. We won't be dealing with the project on the other computer, so this line can be ignored.
  3. `nothing to commit, working directory clean` â€“ this is saying that there are no pending changes.
- Think of this output as the `resting state` (that's not an official description - it's how I like to describe it!). This is the resting state because there are no new files, no changes have been made in files, nothing is in the staging area about to be committed...no change or action is pending, so that's why I like to call it the resting state.
- So this is what it looks like when running `git status` in a repository that already has commits. Let's switch to the `new-git-project` project to see what the `git status` output will produce.
  - ðŸ’¡ Changes in Git v2.14 ðŸ’¡
    In `Git version 2.14`, running the `git status` command in an empty directory changed the wording of `Inital commit` to the much clearer `No commits yet`. So the output would be
    ```
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
    ```

### Explanation Of Git Status In A New Repo
- This is the output of running `git status` in the `new-git-project` project:
```
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```
- To be completely clear, I haven't made any `commits` in my project yet. If you have made a `commit`, then your output should look exactly like that of the `course-git-blog-project` project.
- If you compare this to the `git status` output from the `course-git-blog-project` project, then you'll see that they're pretty similar. The thing to note that's different is that this output includes the line `No commits yet`. This is the tiniest bit confusing because there actually aren't any `commits` in this repository yet! We haven't discussed making a `commit` yet, but when we do, we will be able to make an `initial commit`.
- To prove that there aren't any `commits` in this repo, try running the command `git log` and check out its response:
```
fatal: your current branch 'master' does not have any commits yet
```
  - Well, that's kind of scary looking. `Fatal`? Fortunately, it turns out that just means that the `Git` program is exiting because it can't find any work to do. `Git` tells us this as if it were an error, but it's really not a problem. We know we haven't put any `commits` into this `repo` yet.
  - It's pretty clear from the response that there aren't any `commits`!
- Remember that the output of `git status` will change depending on if files have been `added/deleted/modified`, what's on the `staging index`, and the state of the `repository`.

## Recap
- The `git status` command will display the current status of the repository.
```
git status
```
- This command is extremely important as it will:
  - Tell us about new files that have been created in the `Working Directory` that `Git` hasn't started tracking, yet
  - Files that `Git` is tracking that have been modified
  - Tell us about many more things that we'll explore later
