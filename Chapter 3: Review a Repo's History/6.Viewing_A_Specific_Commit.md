# 6. Viewing A Specific Commit
- There're two ways to display a `specific commit`'s details without worrying about all of the others in the repo
  - Providing the `SHA` of the commit you want to see to `git log`
  - `Using` a new command `git show`
- You can supply the `SHA` of a `commit` as the `final argument` for all of these commands: `git log`, `git log --oneline`, `git log --stat`, and `git log -p`. For example: `git log -p fdf5493`. By supplying a `SHA`, the `git log -p` command will start at that commit! No need to scroll through everything! Keep in mind that it will also show all of the commits that were made prior to the supplied `SHA`.

## New Command: git show
- The other command that shows a `specific commit` is
```
git show
```
- Running it like the example above will only display the `most recent commit`. Typically, a `SHA` is provided as a final argument
```
git show fdf5493
```

## What does git show do?
- The `git show` command will show `only one commit`. The output of the `git show` command is exactly the same as the `git log -p` command. So by default, `git show` displays:
  - the commit
  - the author
  - the date
  - the commit message
  - the patch information
- However, `git show` can be combined with most of the other `flags` we've looked at:
  - `--stat` - to show the how many files were changed and the number of lines that were added/removed
  - `-p` or `--patch` - this the default, but if `--stat` is used, the patch won't display, so pass `-p` to add it again
  - `-w` - to ignore changes to whitespace

  Correct Answer: Option 3
  Hint: First, use `git log --oneline` to find the `SHA` of the commit, then use `git log --stat` with the `SHA` to find the right info.
